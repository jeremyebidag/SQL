--For this project, I'm querying a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
--I performed analytics on the data using SQL



--1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';


--2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


--3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";


--4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';


--5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


--6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT inv.InvoiceId, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId;


--7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName,cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId;


--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';


--9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';


--10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ii.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS 'Track Name'
FROM chinook.invoice_items ii
LEFT JOIN tracks t
ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId;


--11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ii.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS 'Track Name', art.Name AS 'Artist'
FROM chinook.invoice_items ii
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art
ON al.ArtistId = art.ArtistId;


--12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Name', mt.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.TrackId = a.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types mt
ON t.MediaTypeId = mt.MediaTypeId
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;


--13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName;


--14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND i.InvoiceDate like '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.LastName, e.FirstName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC
LIMIT 1;


--15.List all of the employees and the names of who they report to
SELECT a.FirstName, a.LastName, a.Title, b.FirstName, b.LastName, b.Title
FROM chinook.employees a
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees b
ON a.ReportsTo=b.EmployeeID;
